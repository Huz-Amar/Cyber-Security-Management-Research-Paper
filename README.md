# Extending AI Governance Frameworks: A Comparative Analysis of Cybersecurity Policies in the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, and China

## Research Paper Idea
Our baseline paper was **Between Innovation and Oversight: A Cross-Regional Study of AI Risk Management Framework in the EU, US, UK, China by Amir al-Maamari**. This paper analyzed AI frameworks across these four nations to present their frameworks and give an understanding of the different approaches of AI governance on a national scale.

To evaluate the frameworks that these nations choose, the baseline paper defines the following criteria:
| **Dimension**                     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk Management**               | How each nation defines, mitigates, and communicates the security, ethical, and societal risks at play                                    |
| **Governance**                    | Degree of coordination, regulatory comprehensiveness, and oversight across institutions and sectors                                       |
| **Adaptability & Innovation**     | Flexibility to integrate new technologies and encourage innovation while maintaining oversite and regulatory guidelines / controls        |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | Clarity, openness, and enforceability of cybersecurity frameworks and their implementation.                                               |
| **Stakeholder Engagement**        | Level of collaboration and involvement among government, industry, and civil society in shaping and enforcing cybersecurity policy.       |
     
Our research paper extends the baseline paper's foundation, using the same research design and evaluation frameworks. The goal is to give a complementary perspective that situates cybersecurity policy within the the same AI governance frameworks of the baseline paper, to give a broader perspective on how governments manage digital risks and innovation. The idea is not to *replace* the findings of the baseline paper, but to *expand* the scope of the baseline paper to the cybersecurity domain. 

This is done because we recongize a significant gap in current scholarship, which is that few studies have examined AI and cybersecurity governance *together*. There is no authority that collects evidence and ranks cybersecurity controls by efficacy, revealing the lack of a unified or evidence-based cybersecurity governance framework. Even the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act, one of the first major regulatory acts of its kind, had little attention in regard to cybersecurity at large; even the definition of it was not done well. There's also additional information showing that there's inadequate governance policies in regards cybersecurity and large language models, showing that large frameworks still remain unprepared for the convergence of AI and and other cybersecurity risks.

Our research paper seeks to fill this gap by extending from the baseline paper to show how AI and cybersecurity frameworks can overlap and can support each other in the above mentioned evaluation metrics. In doing so, it demonstrates that AI and cybersecurity are not isolated policy fields but interdependent dimensions of digital governance that can evolve together and influence eachother.

Our research design, which is based off of the baseline paper's research design, is as follows:
  1. Begin with data sources, which for us are other research papers and policy documents for the four nations
  2. From there, we perform a comparative policy analysis, then a thematic analysis
  3. This gives us a comparative understanding of the four nations, and we evaluate their frameworks against the above mentioned categories
  4. Case-studies allow us to explore relevant examples to see how these policy decisions and frameworks works in real time

Again, we have the same evaluation criteria as the baseline paper, as shown above

Below are our current findings briefly summarized:
| **Region**             | **Summary of Cybersecurity Approach**                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **European Union**     | Moved from risk-based to threat-based governance. Strong central coordination via NIS2 and CRA, improving resilience but creating regulatory burdens for smaller firms          |
| **United States**      | Market-driven and voluntary frameworks prioritize innovation and flexibility but result in uneven protection.  Social risks emphasized via securing key infrastructure          |     
| **China**              | Highly centralized governance under the CCP, with limited transparency. Cybersecurity equated with national and social control at a country-wide level                          |
| **United Kingdom**     | Pioneered the regulatory sandbox approach, evolving into the sector-specific approach where tech-innovators and regulators work together to navigate the evolving tech landscape|
